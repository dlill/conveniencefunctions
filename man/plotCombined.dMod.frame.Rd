\title{Ideas
Plotting functions as methods, eg plotCombined.dMod.frame
In plotCombined.dMod.frame, when accessing the index, the ggtitle should be updated: "hypothesis, -2LL[index], index"
Combining dMod.frames should be easy as well
dMf_append_plots mit subset-mÃ¶glichkeit, best_prediction erst hire, nicht in dMf_expand_fits}

plotCombined.dMod.frame(plot_bicmet_frame, hypothesis = 1, index = 1, ...)

\description{
Ideas for dMod
in runbg, when starting eg 20 fits per core and the slowly the load decreases, because there are some fits that take ages, kill these few last fits
in norml2, compute the predictions with times individually -> ask Marcus
in +.objfn fix the condition-wise thing
in objfn make a condition_value attribute?
in normL2, when passing an errmodel with conditions, evalute only those conditions with errmodel and the rest without errmodel
}
\details{
plotting_functions: split them into a two-step pipe ("prepare_plotCombined" %>% "render_plotcombined") so that it can be more easily customizable?
str_detect_any
look at reticulate package
First way to OO plotting
